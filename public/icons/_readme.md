This icon set is converted to React components with a script called `svg-inliner`. [Docs here](https://medium.com/@alessio.carnevale/going-in-line-with-svgs-an-mpn-solution-ccdad08734a3).

Currently this is done manually, when new icons are added; this could be done as part of the build script. I do not recommend doing it in dev, though it's probably fine unless the set grows large. -AW
